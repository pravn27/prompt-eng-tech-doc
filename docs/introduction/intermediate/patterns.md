# Intermediate Prompt Engineering Patterns

Welcome to the intermediate level! This section covers more advanced prompt engineering techniques and patterns that will help you create more sophisticated and effective prompts.

## Advanced Prompt Patterns

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to break down complex problems into steps.

#### Example:

```text
Let's solve this math problem step by step:

Problem: If a store offers a 20% discount on a $100 item, what's the final price?

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount
Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price
Step 3: State the final price

Let's solve it:
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning

Few-shot learning provides examples to help the model understand the desired output format.

#### Example:

```text
Here are some examples of product descriptions:

Example 1:
Product: Wireless Headphones
Description: Premium wireless headphones with noise cancellation, 30-hour battery life, and comfortable over-ear design.

Example 2:
Product: Smart Watch
Description: Feature-rich smartwatch with heart rate monitoring, GPS tracking, and water resistance up to 50m.

Now, write a similar description for:
Product: Bluetooth Speaker
```

### 3. Role-Based Contextual Prompts

Combining role-based prompting with specific context for more targeted responses.

#### Example:

```text
You are an experienced software architect with 15 years of experience in cloud computing.
Given the following requirements:
- Need to handle 1 million users
- Must be scalable
- Should be cost-effective

Design a high-level architecture for a social media platform.
```

## Advanced Formatting Techniques

### 1. Structured Output Formats

```text
Analyze the following text and provide the output in this format:

TEXT: [Your text here]

ANALYSIS:
- Main Topic:
- Key Points:
- Sentiment:
- Recommendations:
```

### 2. Conditional Formatting

```text
If the sentiment is positive, format the response in green.
If the sentiment is negative, format the response in red.
If the sentiment is neutral, format the response in blue.

Analyze: "The new product launch was a huge success!"
```

## Context Management

### 1. Maintaining Conversation Context

```text
Previous context:
- User asked about Python decorators
- We discussed basic decorator syntax

Current question: How do I create a decorator that measures function execution time?

Please provide an answer that builds upon our previous discussion.
```

### 2. Context Window Optimization

```text
Summarize the key points from our previous discussion about API design, then answer the new question about REST best practices.
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### 1. Handling Ambiguity

```text
If the question is ambiguous, ask for clarification on:
1. The specific aspect they're interested in
2. Any constraints or requirements
3. The expected output format

Question: "Tell me about databases"
```

### 2. Fallback Strategies

```text
If the model cannot provide a complete answer, it should:
1. Acknowledge the limitation
2. Provide partial information
3. Suggest alternative approaches

Task: Explain quantum computing to a high school student
```

## Best Practices for Intermediate Users

1. **Context Management**

   - Keep track of conversation history
   - Use context windows effectively
   - Clear context when switching topics

2. **Error Prevention**

   - Anticipate potential misunderstandings
   - Include validation steps
   - Provide fallback options

3. **Output Control**
   - Use specific formatting instructions
   - Implement conditional responses
   - Structure complex outputs

## Practice Exercises

1. **Exercise 1**: Create a chain-of-thought prompt for solving a complex business problem
2. **Exercise 2**: Design a few-shot learning prompt for generating product descriptions
3. **Exercise 3**: Write a role-based contextual prompt for a technical architecture review
