# Beginner's Guide to Prompt Engineering

Welcome to the beginner's guide! This section will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Prompt Engineering and help you get started with creating effective prompts.

## What is a Prompt?

A prompt is a text input that you provide to an AI language model to get a specific response. Think of it as giving instructions to the AI about what you want it to do.

## Basic Prompt Structure

A basic prompt typically consists of:

1. **Task Description**: What you want the AI to do
2. **Context**: Any relevant background information
3. **Format**: How you want the response structured

### Example 1: Simple Task

```text
Write a short poem about spring.
```

### Example 2: Task with Context

```text
Given that it's spring and flowers are blooming, write a short poem about the season.
```

### Example 3: Task with Format

```text
Write a short poem about spring. Format it with:
- Title
- 4 lines
- Rhyming scheme
```

## Common Prompt Patterns

### 1. Direct Questions

```text
What is the capital of France?
```

### 2. Role-Based Prompts

```text
Act as a math teacher and explain how to solve quadratic equations.
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

```text
Explain how to make a sandwich in 5 simple steps.
```

## Best Practices for Beginners

1. **Be Clear and Specific**

   - ❌ "Write about dogs"
   - ✅ "Write a 100-word description of the benefits of having a pet dog"

2. **Provide Context**

   - ❌ "Summarize this article"
   - ✅ "Summarize this article about climate change in 3 bullet points"

3. **Specify Format**
   - ❌ "Give me a recipe"
   - ✅ "Provide a recipe for chocolate cake with ingredients and steps"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Being Too Vague**

   - ❌ "Tell me about history"
   - ✅ "Explain the key events of the American Revolution"

2. **Overloading the Prompt**

   - ❌ "Write a story, include characters, plot, and make it funny"
   - ✅ "Write a short, humorous story about a day in the life of a cat"

3. **Missing Context**
   - ❌ "Fix this code"
   - ✅ "Fix the syntax error in this Python function that calculates the average"

## Practice Exercises

Try these exercises to improve your prompt engineering skills:

1. **Exercise 1**: Write a prompt to get a recipe for chocolate chip cookies
2. **Exercise 2**: Create a prompt to get a summary of a book
3. **Exercise 3**: Write a prompt to get help with a math problem
